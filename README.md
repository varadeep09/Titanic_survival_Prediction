# 3.Modeling
Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).

ii)Handling Missing Values
iii)Model Training
